<Meta title="About this Project" />

## Architecture

It is based on a DDD Approach, splitting every 
"responsibility / concern" into a new folder or file.

There are a few ones:

#### @types folder

Custom application types + Typing enhancements for other libs.

#### assets folder

Images and icons dynamically imported into the app.

#### components folder

Reusable page parts, a common pattern for *React apps*.

#### contexts folder

Assertive data layers provided for the app to use within the app.

#### guards folder

Middlewares for routes, but reflects big changes on the app.

#### hooks folder

Some code utilities used by react to execute behaviors.

#### internals folder

Lib overrides and enhancements for the app's purposes.

#### layouts folder

Reusable page structures, avoiding code duplicating patterns.

#### models folder

Reusable validators, so you can ensure the data models used by the app.

#### pages folder

Literal pages, already composed by **layouts** and enhanced with content.

#### routes folder

All the routes, divided by an URI Resource.

#### scripts folder

Code parts, injected and executed before rendering the React **App**.

#### services folder

Business and built-in layers to help with the application's environment.

#### stories folder

Responsible for dedicated application pages.

#### styles folder

Global/Main styles for the app.

#### utils folder

small built-in utilities by javascript concept domain.

#### App.tsx file

App' base

#### main.tsx file

App's render core + global imports and changes before React renders.


## Render Layers / Render Order

[1st] createRoot<br />
  // Where the App starts to render.<br />

[2nd] -> App Provider<br />
// We load the data layers.<br />

[3rd] -> Store Provider<br />
[4th] -> Features Provider<br />
[5th] -> Theme Provider<br />
[6th] -> Auth Provider<br />

[7th] -> App Router (as Router-DOM's BrowserRouter)<br />
// Then we provide the pages through routes.<br />

[8th] -> Router's Error Boundary<br />
[9th] -> Layouts (Page Layouts, Auth Layouts etc...)ยน<br />
[10th] -> Pages (then components, hooks etc...)<br />

ยน: It can have 0 to x Layouts stacked.
