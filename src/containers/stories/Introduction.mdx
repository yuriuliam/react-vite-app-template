<Meta title="About this Project" />

## Architecture

It is based on a Clean Approach, splitting each responsibility into a new folder or file.

There are a few ones:

## @types folder

Responsible for declaring the typings used by our application. Sometimes overriding or enhancing the already existing ones.

## configs folder

All the possible configurations - such as Constants and Client Defaults - used by the app - not considering `.env` variables.

## containers folder

Our interface/render layers, split by groups of responsibilities - then pages.

## data folder

Declaration of our protocols and infrastructure basis.

## infra folder

Implementation of our protocols and infrastructure declarations.

## modules folder

App Features, also split by groups of responsibilities.

## shared folder

Utilities, and general-use errors, models and functions which can be consumed by the whole app.

## main.tsx

Entrypoint of our app.
